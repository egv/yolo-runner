# E7-T14 Backpressure and output-rate controls

STRICT TDD: failing tests first. Add bounded queues, drop/coalesce policy for high-volume output, and --verbose-stream switch.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given high output volume, when streaming, then agent remains responsive and stream remains parseable with documented rate behavior.
