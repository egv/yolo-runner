# E10-T12 Document deferred v2.1 scope (repo suggestions, multi-workspace, advanced activities)

STRICT TDD for docs checks: add tests/assertions that docs clearly mark deferred features and migration path.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given docs and roadmap checks, when reviewed, then deferred items are explicit and linked to v2.1.
