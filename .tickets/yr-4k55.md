# Implement TaskEngine dependency resolution

Implement GetNextAvailable method to return tasks with satisfied dependencies.

## Description
Create the dependency resolution logic that determines which tasks are ready for execution based on their dependency status.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given failing tests from Task 4, when implementation complete, GetNextAvailable tests pass
- Given graph with open tasks, when GetNextAvailable called, returns tasks with no dependencies OR all deps completed
- Given graph with blocked task, when dependencies complete, task becomes available on next call
- Given graph with mix of completed/in-progress/open tasks, when checked, only truly available tasks returned
- Given empty graph, when GetNextAvailable called, returns empty slice (no error)

## TDD Protocol
- Ensure tests are failing before implementation
- Implement topological ordering logic
- Handle edge cases (missing nodes, self-references)
- Refactor while keeping tests green

## Dependencies
- Depends on: yr-ho6u
