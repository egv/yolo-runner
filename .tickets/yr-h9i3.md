# E7-T23 Production polish and docs for GUI workflow

STRICT TDD where applicable: finalize styles/components, update migration and operator docs, add runbook and examples for production usage.


## Notes

**2026-02-10T08:19:52Z**

STRICT TDD where applicable. Final polish/docs must explicitly document required UI libs: Bubble Tea, Bubbles, Lip Gloss and Elm-style architecture expectations.
