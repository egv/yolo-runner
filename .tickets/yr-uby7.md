# E7-T21 Add memory and render performance controls

STRICT TDD: optimize state and rendering for baseline 10 workers/500 tasks using bounded derived caches, efficient diffing, and viewport-aware rendering.


## Notes

**2026-02-10T08:19:52Z**

STRICT TDD required. Add failing performance/memory behavior tests first; enforce baseline support for 10 workers / 500 tasks.
