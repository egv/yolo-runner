# E10-T8 Session runtime orchestration

STRICT TDD: failing tests first. Orchestrate session run loop: created starts execution, prompted appends user input and continues.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given created and prompted events, when runtime executes, then session work progresses correctly and final response is emitted.
