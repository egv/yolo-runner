# E7-T11 Heartbeat and no-output stall indicators

STRICT TDD: failing tests first. Emit runner_heartbeat and stale-output warnings on schedule with configurable thresholds.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given long-running tasks, when no output interval exceeds threshold, then stream and tui show heartbeat and stall warnings.
