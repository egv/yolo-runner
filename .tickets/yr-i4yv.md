# E10-T11 E2E demo: created+prompted session flow

STRICT TDD: add e2e tests first. Demonstrate one complete created flow and one prompted follow-up flow in single workspace.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given test workspace session, when created then prompted event occurs, then thought/action/response lifecycle completes successfully.
