# E12-T1 Define command contract and strict TDD checklist

Define CLI UX, exit-code contract, validation scope, and strict TDD checklist to be enforced across all E12 tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria

Contract documents syntax and exit codes, and every E12 task includes mandatory RED->GREEN->REFACTOR steps with recorded failing and passing test commands in task notes before close.
