# Implement GitHub Storage Backend with sub-issue support

Implement the StorageBackend interface for GitHub Issues with proper parent-child relationship handling.

## Description
Create a new GitHub backend that correctly fetches sub-issues using GitHub's parent_issue_id field instead of treating all issues as children of root.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given failing tests from Task 3, when implementation complete, all tests pass
- Given Epic #52, when GetTaskTree called, returns only issues #58-#65 (actual sub-issues)
- Given Epic #52, when GetTaskTree called, does NOT include Epic #53 or unrelated issues
- Given task with GitHub sub-issues, when fetched, parent-child relationships preserved
- Given issue with dependencies in body, when fetched, dependencies parsed and stored
- Given rate limit approaching, when API called, implements appropriate backoff

## TDD Protocol
- Ensure tests from Task 3 are failing before implementation
- Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- Refactor while keeping tests green
- Add integration tests with real GitHub API (mocked)

## Dependencies
- Depends on: yr-io10
