# E10-T4 Implement AgentActivity client (thought/action/response)

STRICT TDD: failing tests first. Implement GraphQL mutations for thought/action/response emission with retry-safe idempotency keys.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given execution lifecycle, when activities are sent, then users see thought/action progress and final response in Linear.
